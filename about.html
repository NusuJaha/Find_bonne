                   <h2> ABOUT US </h2> 
           
           
           
                   <p> Bonne means caring, supportive and delightful.  Bonne is a web platform to help people, specially employed women to foster their children with proper care and medication. So, we will build a system where people will get adequate and trustworthy babysitters for their children whom they can trust indiscreetly. </p>

<p> Since the rate of the birth of the children are increasing day by day, the number of working women in decreasing. From the perspective of the Bangladesh and any other developing countries, this is necessary for most parents because many families require two incomes to get by financially. </p>
                       
                     <p>  To resolve all the given problems, we want to implement the service “Bonne". Bonne is necessary for our society To ensure the parents that, their kids are in good hands, To encourage women in job sectors, To ensure safety of the children, and To create a platform for earning money for the university students or any other people who are qualified enough to take proper care of a child. Bonne is also important for academic advancement, learning the interaction with other adults, smoother transition to Kindergarten, moreover social and economic benefits for parents.  </p>

                      <p> Therefore, first we will construct a platform where people from all over the country can register themselves first. Some as guardians, the others as benefactor. This will be a quite lengthy procedure for registration. We might ask for their NID, Passport or Birth Certificate, NOC, or sometimes Police clearance to verify them. For security purpose, we will collect data and submit to the respective police stations so that no further occurrences held. After the registration process, We can assign one bonne to one child on the guardian’s preferred time. We will also have few rules and regulations for the workers. They are also required to show updates to the guardians through text messages or giving snaps of the child. </p>

<p> For one hour every bonne will be charged 150 BDT initially. We might give few voucher code in the beginning so that the gurdians can understand the essence. </p>

<p> This will ultimately help the guardians to ensure the safety of the child, as well as a source to earn money for the youths on their leisure time. Overall, Bonne has a great socio-economic and academic impact on our society. </p>

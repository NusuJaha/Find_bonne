                   <p> BONNE is committed to respecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the personal information we collect through our website, and how we collect and use this information. Terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Service.  

This Privacy Policy is organized into the following  sections:
                       </p>

                   <p> 
         <br> 1. Collection and Use of Personal Information
 <br> 2. Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
 <br> 3. Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties 
 <br> 4. Updating and Correcting Information
 <br> 5. Your Choices
 <br> 6. Security of Information
 <br> 7. Age Restrictions
 <br> 8. Changes to Privacy Policy
 <br> 9. Questions About This Privacy Policy <br>
         
 <br> <P  text-align: justify;> *Collection and Use of Personal Information.
Depending on how you use the Site, we may ask you to share personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") with us. Whether you choose to share your Personal Information is completely up to you, but keep in mind that you may not be able to access some areas of the Site or effectively use the services we offer on the Site without sharing Personal Information. Personal Information includes any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate you. Examples include your name, address, email address, phone number, age, household information, educational background and credit card information. 

User Profile. After you register for the Site, you will have the opportunity to create a Profile about yourself. Your Profile may include different information depending on whether you are a Parent or a Sitter. How much information you disclose on your Profile is entirely up to you, though at a minimum, your Profile will include information you provided to us in the account registration process (though your contact information, as well as certain other information, is disclosed only in the limited manner described below) and certain information about your Site activity (described in subsection 6 below).
         
For Parents: Parents may include information on their Profile about their children (age, school, allergies, special needs), emergency contact information, parking availability, and group affiliations. All registered Users will be able to view the Parent's photo, first name, last initial, neighborhood and (if elected) number of children. In addition, other registered Parents and Sitters can view shared connections and affiliations. When a Parent reviews a Sitter or requests a booking with a Sitter, the Sitter can view the Parent's full Profile.
         
For Sitters: Sitters may include information about their hourly rates, background, availability, education, certifications, languages spoken and experience, and any geographic or other limitations or preferences. All visitors to the Site (including non-registered visitors) can view a Sitter's Profile, except that a Sitter's email, address and phone number is disclosed only to a Parent with a confirmed booking.
         
         
Messaging. The Site allows you to exchange messages with other Users using the messaging feature. We may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them.

                       
Payment Information. To process payments, we will require your credit card information and billing information. Users will also have the option of storing this information as part of their account information.
                       
Job Postings. Information in your job postings, excluding your name (unless you include it in your job description) and profile photo, but including such other information as your neighborhood, city and state, job description (including number and age of children, hours needed, qualifications desired, rate offered) and job posting date may be shared with third party search engines and other services who run classified advertisements. Note that if you include Personal Information about yourself in your job description (e.g., your name or contact information), it may appear in the shared job postings and may be accessible to the public. These shared job postings may appear in third party web site search results, and would allow the public to link back to your UrbanSitter posting. To view your complete job posting, a user would then need to register and/or log in to the UrbanSitter site.
         
Feedback. If you contact us to give us feedback, register a complaint or ask questions about the Site or Services, we may store your communications, including any Personal Information you include in them, so we can effectively respond to you.
Teen Sitters. If you are a Teen Sitter, we will also, either during or after the registration process, use the Personal Information you have provided to us, to ask you for the name, email and/or phone number of your parent or legal guardian (“Teen Sitter’s Parent”), and we will use this information to contact Teen Sitter’s Parent to obtain their consent for you to register and use the Site. </P>
    
     <P  text-align: justify;>   * Updating and Correcting Information. 
 If you need to change your Personal Information, you may update or correct this information by logging into your account and accessing either the "Profile" section within your account or the "Settings" section under "My Account." We encourage you to update your Personal Information promptly if it changes. 

If you choose to store credit card information on the Site, this is stored on a secure page and you may delete your credit card information at any time by accessing the "My Account" section within your account and clicking on "Payment." 

<P> * Your Choices.
UrbanSitter provides you with the ability to opt-out of receiving promotional emails (e.g., monthly newsletters, new service offerings, special discounts and third-party offers) from us. If you wish to discontinue receiving promotion emails, you can opt-out by using the link on the bottom of every promotional email you receive from UrbanSitter.

    Please note that you cannot opt-out of receiving administrative and transaction-related emails from us. These are emails that relate to your account or your activity on the Site. </P>

<P  text-align: justify;> * Security of Information.
    We take security of your Personal Information seriously and take precautions to protect your Personal Information. We encrypt certain sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and implement other commercially reasonable procedures to protect your Personal Information. But, no method of data transmission over the Internet or data storage is 100% secure and therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information transmitted to or from the Site. </P>

<P  text-align: justify;> * Age Restrictions.
    With the exception of Teen Sitters as described in 1.19, the Site is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 18, and no part of the Site is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18. If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that an individual under 18 has opened an account and provided us with Personal Information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate that person's account. </P>




<P  text-align: justify;> We do not sell your personal information to third parties. UrbanSitter may share your personal information with third parties and third parties may collect your personal information as described above in the Collection and Use of Personal Information and Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties sections.



<p  text-align: justify;> * Changes to Our Privacy Policy.
We may revise our Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will always be located on this webpage. If we make a change to our Privacy Policy that is material, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before implementing the change on the Site and/or via the email associated with your account. By continuing to access the Site and use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy. </p>

<p> * Contact Us.
If you have any feedback, questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or any of our privacy-related practices, please contact us directly at:
